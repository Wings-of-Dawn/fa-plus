# fa-plus

FurAffinity Plus is a Chrome Extension intended to improve the user experience of the FurAffinity website (https://www.furaffinity.net).

The extension is not published in the Chrome web store, as doing so requires a paid developer account, but it can be installed locally as an "unpacked" extension.

## Installation

1. Click "Download ZIP" under GitHub's "Code" button and unarchive the file to an out-of-the-way location (i.e., I don't suggest leaving it in your "Downloads" directory; the files will need to stay on your computer for the extension to work)
    1. If you're familiar with `git`, you can clone the repo, instead
1. In your browser, open the Extensions page (e.g., type chrome://extensions in the navbar)
1. Enable "developer mode" via the toggle at the top-right of the page
1. Click "Load Unpacked", and select the folder containing the code

### Caveats

If the files you downloaded are moved or deleted, some parts of the browser extension will stop working. To fix this, remove the extension (in chrome://extensions) and follow the installation instructions again.

### Optional Settings

By default, Chrome prevents extensions from running in Incognito mode. To allow this, go to chrome://extensions and click the "Details" button for FA+ and enable the "Allow in incognito" toggle.

Additional extension-specific settings can be accessed via the "Extension options" link on the same page, or via the "Options" menu item in the three-dots menu next to FA+ under the browser's extensions icon.
