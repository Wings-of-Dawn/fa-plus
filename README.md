# fa-plus
FurAffinity Plus is a Chrome Extension intended to improve the user experience of the FurAffinity website (https://www.furaffinity.net).

The extension is not published in the Chrome web store, as doing so requires a paid developer account, but it can be installed locally as a "developer mode" extension.

(TODO: instructions for developer mode installation)
